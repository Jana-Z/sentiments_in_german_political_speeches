## Sample plots / Documentation
All plots were made using the functions in `sentiments_in_political_speeches/plotting/emotions_plotter.py`.

### `plot_average_score()`
plots a box plot using all data and thus gives a overview over the average usage of each emotion in the overall dataset:

### `plot_mean_per_year_all_emotions()`
plots a line plot for all emotions in the dataset and puts all emotions onto one graph. The data before 2000 varys a lot, which could be due to the smaller datasize.

### `plot_mean_per_year()`
plots a line plot for one emotion in the dataset. The data before 2000 varys a lot, which could be due to the smaller datasize.

### `plot_per_year_all_emotions()`
plots a scatter plot for all emotions in the dataset and puts all emotions onto one graph. The data before 2000 varys a lot, which could be due to the smaller datasize.
